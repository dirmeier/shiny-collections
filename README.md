# shiny-collections

A collection of some plots to check out shiny.

## Introduction

This is just a test implementation of a `shiny` server with some custom `css` and a few plots to
see how it compares with other web-stacks I like, such as [`mean.io`](http://mean.io/).

Find the app [here](https://dirmeier.shinyapps.io/shiny-collections/).
